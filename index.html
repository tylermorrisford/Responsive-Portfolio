            <p class="floattext">I am a front-end web developer, writer, and videographer, currently serving as the communications manager for ‘<a href="https://slcjcc.org" class="biolink" target="_blank">the J</a>’. I’m also studying to be a full-stack developer, and while you’re probably thinking, “cool story, nerd!” I will put up a fight if you try to take my lunch money.  I am fueled by granola bars and la croix, and I have a crippling weakness for fried foods, smoked meats, regular meats, bacon, smoked bacon, crispy bacon, the mere mention of bacon, fried foods served alongside smoked meats and/or bacon, and bacon. </p>
            <p>My sister and I were born in Gilroy, California, and having been there recently and noted the amazing growth, I wonder when they’ll start to refer to it as San Jose Heights. My dad was a commercial pilot, and despite the fact that he attended college on a football scholarship, he is basically a nerd in jock’s clothing. My mom was a professional ballet dancer, then teacher, then stayed home to raise some smelly kids, and dna tests have shown her to be primarily a nerd but also a hippie. My sister told on me a lot(twice), but she is now an amazing mother of 5 children that laughs just about always and lives on dr. pepper and dad jokes(like a nerd). I guess my point is that the (nerd)apple can’t fall far from the (nerd)tree if it’s surrounded on all sides by apple trees(and nerds). So to speak. I apologize if I just lost you.</p>

            <p>A little bit about me, I have two very cute and very loud children, a beautiful wife who is also my best friend in the world, and I sometimes feel like I can’t fathom why I would deserve any of these things unless in some past life I was a bird that flew into the path of a bullet that would’ve otherwise killed elton john. Pre-yellow brick road, obviously.</p>
